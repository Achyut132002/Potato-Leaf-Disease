# Potato-Leaf-Disease Predictor 

## Problem Statement:-

### "Farmers every year face economic loss and crop waste due to various diseases in potato plants. Early blight and Late blight are major disease of potato leaf. It is estimated that the major loss occurred in potato yield is due to these diseases" .

Thus the images are classified into 3 classes :

*  *Healthy leaves*

*  *Late Blight leaves*

## Technology stack used :- 

+ **Tensorflow**
+ **Numpy**
+ **Keras**
+ **Matplotlib**
+ **Pathlib**

## Dataset :-

The dataset is being taken from ["Kaggle"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village).

Dataset contains 15 different directories:-


+ *Potato___Early_blight*

+ *Potato___Late_blight*

+ *Potato___healthy*

each containing images in **.jpg** format.

## Output:-



![image](https://github.com/sanils2002/Potato-Leaf-Disease/assets/81878805/659b821c-420a-45f3-963a-b435566392f6)


The model accuracy after training the image dataset is > **97%** .
